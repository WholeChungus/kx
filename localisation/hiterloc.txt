hitler.1.t:0 "An Interesting Interview"
hitler.1.d:0 "The literary world has been taken by storm by the rising career of a certain young celebrity journalist, one Annelies Marie Frank that has published a tell-all interview with famed hero of the Weltkrieg turned pro-wrestler who has since become an aspiring writer and artist of dubious quality, the revered veteran Adolf Hitler. During this interview, Hitler discussed and divulged much of his interesting career with Ms. Frank, regaling her with tales of his struggles both on the battlefield at Somme and Passchendaele, and in the ring against the likes of other pro-German wrestlers and boxers such as Max Schmeling and Walter Neusel. He also talked about the anti-semitic scandal that got him banned and blacklisted from the German wrestling scene, but has defended himself to Ms. Frank tonight, stating "Jewish Question? What ‘Jewish Question’? The only question is why these media hounds have sullied my name so. I have never been an antisemite and I have done nothing wrong in my career as a veteran and a pro-wrestler, though I admit my writing and art may have offended some with their sheer amateurity. I detest these accusations categorically..." His defense droned on for a while, seeing him gesticulate and shout wildly as he defended his position of anti-antisemitism and the purity of the Jewish race. Overall, aside from this odd outburst, it was a rather dull interview, but still shined some light on this German war hero that has since faded into obscurity."

hitler.2.t:0 "The Glorious Traditions of German Art Restored"
hitler.2.d:0 "Buzz and sensation has vibrated throughout the upper echelons of Germany’s cultural community as a new art form rushes to captivate both the old masters and the masses. Coming from the warped and patriotic mind of Adolf Hitler, the newest darling of the German art scene, a new, exciting artform has sprung forth that seeks to capture the very essence of Germany itself. Working with Otto Dix, their movement known as ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’, or New Objectivity, is seen by many as a return to form for classically-inspired German art. Dix, George Grosz, and Hitler, among others in their school, reject Expressionism and other forms of modern art, instead drawing upon similar styles from the old German master painters such as Holbein the Younger, Albrecht Dürer, Caspar Friedrich, and from Italian and Northern Renaissance painters from across the spectrum of traditional art, these masters of the brush have endeavored to return a slice of Germany’s former traditions and glories and bring them to the forefront of public consciousness in the Kaiserreich. With their art, they seek to teach the German people to embrace tradition and reject the modern, liberal world. However, if they are successful in doing so remains to be seen. Regardless, their art has proven to be exceedingly popular in the wider German Empire, and Hitler and the other members of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement are quickly rising to be the most popular artists in the Fatherland."
