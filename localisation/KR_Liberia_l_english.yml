LIB_slavery_scandal:0 "1930 Slavery Scandal"
LIB_slavery_scandal_desc:0 "After losing the 1927 presidential election to King, Thomas Faulkner accused many members of the True Whig Party government of recruiting and selling contract labor as slaves. Despite Liberia's firm denials and a refusal to cooperate, the US established a commission under the leadership of British zoologist Cuthbert Christy to determine the extent of forced labor and slavery still practiced by Liberia. U.S. President Herbert Hoover briefly suspended relations to press Monrovia into compliance. In 1930 the United States published the committee's report, dubbed the ‘Christy Report’ after the Committee's chairman. The report supported many of Faulkner's allegations and implicated many government officials, including vice president Allen Yancy. It was found that forced labor was used for the construction of certain public works such as roads in the interior. And certain tribes did practice domestic servitude that could be considered as slavery. While King managed to secure his position as president this scandal is a great source of national embarassment for Liberia and it has severely damaged our standing with the world's great powers."
LIB_negro_settlements:0 "Negro Settler Nation"
LIB_negro_settlements_desc:0 "Liberia was founded as a homeland for freed African-American slaves. Negroes make up our entire political apparatus and are the only ones besides Americans and European foreigners that are contributing anything of note to our economy. Consequently the Liberian Frontier Force, our main army, only consists of about 800 Negro troops. Our main cities; Monrovia, Marshall, Edina, Grand Bassa, Jacktown, Greenville, Nifu, Grand Cess, Garawa and Harper are where the vast majority of our Negro population is located. Beyond that there is only the Hinterland; a heavily desputed border region with National France and Westafrika full of unruly natives. Our control of this region is abysmally marginal and we as a nation effectively only exist on the coast."

### Events ###
LIB.1.t:0 "Liberian Introduction"
LIB.1.d:0 "At approximately the size of Virginia, Liberia is an independent West African nation under the protection of the United States of America. The upper crust of society belongs to a solid voting bloc called the True Whig Party, which has won every major election since 1870. The Americo Liberians were responsible for spreading Christianity to the natives, but have adopted some West African traditions along the way. Secret Societies, such as Poro for the lower classes and the Masonic Order of Liberia at the top ensure that the rich stay rich, and the poor can govern themselves in secrecy. The Weltkrieg was a dark and conspiratorial time for Liberia. The French listening post in Monrovia was nearly discovered, the German Ambassador disappeared under suspitious circumstances, and the borders moved. During the Revolution in Britain, Sierra Leone was occupied and then annexed by France. The wave of Leonese refugees was only exceeded by the Ivorian refugees later. Deutsche Mittelafrika seized the French colony of Côte d'Ivoire in the confusion of the French Revolution, creating even more tensions. Now Liberia is engulfed by debt from failed projects, her economy in the hands of Firestone Natural Rubber, and her future uncertain. Will Edwin Barclay, a legitimist in the TWP, be able to save Liberia from disaster?"
LIB.1.a:0 "All Hail Liberia, Hail."

LIB.2.t:0 "Race Relations in Liberia"
LIB.2.d:0 "Since the founding of our Republic, the Americo-Liberian population, originally descended from freed black slaves from the southern United States, have held all political and economic power in the country at the detriment of the more numerous indigenous African peoples of the interior. The Citizenship Act of 1932 was intended as a tradeoff between representation and taxation. In practice however, the Citizenship Act is unenforced, but taxed. Should we force our Governors to allow natives into provincial assembly halls, or are they right to withold this right until the nation is again stable?"
LIB.2.a:0 "Uphold our reputation, give the natives a voice."
LIB.2.b:0 "Uphold out traditons, they must know their place."

LIB.3.t:0 "Presidential Elections, 1939"
LIB.3.d:0 "Today it's election day on our Republic, the first to allow both Americo Liberians and Native Liberians. Four main candidates are participating. President Charles King has chosen not to run for another term, and now the leadership of the TWP is anyone’s game. Edwin Barclay is the favourite to lead, yet others have thrown their hat into the race. The sensible socialist J.J. Dossen of the Liberian Democratic Rally has also attempted to run, however nobody in their right mind would expect him to win.
LIB.3.a:0 "Edwin James Barclay, True Whig Party."
LIB.3.b:0 "William Tubman, True Whig Party."
LIB.3.c:0 "Louis Arthur Grimes, True Whig Party."
LIB.3.e:0 "James Jenkins Dossen, Liberia Democratic Rally."

LIB.5.t:0 "Black Monday Reaches Liberia"
LIB.5.d:0 "After the total collapse of the German stock exchange, ripples have already begun to hit foreign shores. After the US stock market crashed, we had hoped a tragedy like this would not have happened to us so soon. Now we must pick up the pieces, again."
LIB.5.a:0 "We Must Act Soon!"

LIB.6.t:0 "Allocation Of Government Funds"
LIB.6.d:0 "We have Funds in our annual budget that we use for dealing with our rivals, including bribing them. However, this year's global economic meltdown may be more important a use than paying all our rivals into submission. This may be risky for our regime though..."
LIB.6.a:0 "Kickbacks ain't so bad."
LIB.6.b:0 "Put the money in the reserve."

LIB.7.t:0 "Secret Societies In Liberia?"
LIB.7.d:0 "Secret Societies exist in both the American and Native traditions in Liberia. The Americo Liberians at the top of society defer to the Masonic Order of Liberia for political advancement. At the lowest end of society, Poros solidify tribal identitiy through their role as tribal leaders. The propensity for secrecy in Liberia has led to a major disconnect in society, so much so we have a special word for it. Ifa Mo. We could empower Poros and the Masons to join the government, and help reconsturct our economy through community service. Or we could justify banishing them from the public eye, saying that their activities are frivolous wastes of public funds."
LIB.7.a:0 "Secret Societies must come out of the dark."
LIB.7.b:0 "Poros and Masons are abhorent and sacreligious, ban them."

LIB.8.t:0 "The Hut Tax Situation"
LIB.8.d:0 "The Hut tax system was used in British colonies to help simulate the economy and to get native Africans participating in the local economy. The 1932 Citizenship Act implemented a $$1 Hut Tax on each native household, in return for voting rights. There is a pull towards eliminating the tax, as it resembles the hated US poll tax on African Americans. At the same time, we need all the money we can get."
LIB.8.a:0 "A minor increase, we will all benefit from the results."
LIB.8.b:0 "Abolish the tax, keep the village chiefs quiet for once."

LIB.9.t:0 "Liberalism Washes onto Africa"
LIB.9.d:0 "In the past few days a liberal movement has gained steam and has been pushing across the Atlantic. Most strongly emanating from the U.S, where Afro-American culture promises a brighter future past racial segregation, which is still legal in Liberia. Crashing against not only colonial policy, but our elders' ways. Could Womens Suffrage be far away, or will this weaken our foundations of government?"
LIB.9.a:0 "Where is this coming from?"

LIB.10.t:0 "The Freemasons Attempt a Coup!"
LIB.10.d:0 "During the first festival after legalizing Secret Societies, an unusual sight marches through the streets of Monrovia. At it's head is disgraced Grandmaster A. Dash Wilson. Along with several members of the Masonic Order of Liberia, A. Dash Wilson leading an armed parade towards the Presidential Palace! Why would the powerful Freemasons betray us now?"
LIB.10.a:0 "Abandon Monrovia! Leave Barclay to the wolves."
LIB.10.b:0 "These traitors have no power, arrest them!"
LIB.10.c:0 "Turn to Firestone! They can save us."

LIB.11.t:0 "The Red Tide Hits Liberia!"
LIB.11.d:0 "The banning of secret societies has left our own political sphere weakened. Nobody alerted us to the Liberian Destiny gang led by George Padmore tearing through the Hinterlands. Padmore an American immigrant who became excited by Bill Haywood's syndicalist ideology, and intends to create syndicalism in Africa. Padmore's band of syndicalists has now entered Monrovia armed and dangerous, seeking out our President. The Fate of Liberia is at stake!"
LIB.11.a:0 "I've got it! Defend the boats as we escape."
LIB.11.b:0 "The Liberian Frontier Force should fix them."
LIB.11.c:0 "Turn to Firestone! They can save us."

LIB.12.t:0 "The Foreigner Conspiracy"
LIB.12.d:0 "With the new government now in our control, we need to understand our own position. Just as we overthrew Liberia, so could the foreigner American immigrants within Liberia do onto us. Since the listening outpost and bombardment of Liberia, foreigners from Europe have shown their ulterior motive to subdue us. While some of our members within the Lodge may have important business ties abroad, our Grandmaster knows that this willl only erode our resolve."
LIB.12.a:0 "Unfamiliar people are a threat to Ifa Mo. Silence them!"
LIB.12.b:0 "Persecuting foreigners is biting the hand that feeds."

LIB.13.t:0 "The Red Menace"
LIB.13.d:0 "Socialism and Syndicalism have caused massive unrest in both the US and abroad. From the fall of France to this very day the growing red threat will not abate until we crush it ourselves! One only needs to look at the disgraced J.J Dossen, who adopeted socialism save his failing political career. The only reservation shown by the Grand Lodge is the wealth from American immigrants would respond poorly. Persecuting immigrants could erode their confidence in the government, and thus their economic potential along with them."
LIB.13.a:0 "Syndicalism will never take this country!"
LIB.13.b:0 "Yes, all of the two socialists in Liberia need our attention...next please."

LIB.14.t:0 "The end of the Republicans"
LIB.14.d:0 "For too long the True Whig Party has supressed our ideas for a free market economy. It took an economic catastrophe to correct our single party state. Should we enshrine in the Liberian Constitution the need to be in a Princ Hall Freemason Lodge in order to serve the public? Should we ensure our partys security in perpetuity, or is a two party system a better outcome."
LIB.14.a:0 "Republicans own the Liberian Republic."
LIB.14.b:0 "A Two Party System is tradition."

LIB.20.t:0 "The Dawn of the African Commonwealth!"
LIB.20.d:0 "With our total control over West Africa we can now form a Commonwealth of freeman nations, not unlike the one formed by the dominions of the former British empire. In this world of ideological warfare and economic exploitation, we free men of West Africa need to stand together. This will allow us to best represent the diversity of West Africa in a democratic fashion."
LIB.20.a:0 "Excellent."

LIB.21.t:0 "Releasing Guinea."
LIB.21.d:0 "Guinea shall be freed into our new African Commonwealth"
LIB.21.a:0 "Our Commonwealth grows."

LIB.22.t:0 "Releasing The Gold Coast."
LIB.22.d:0 "The Gold Coast shall be freed into our new African Commonwealth"
LIB.22.a:0 "Our Commonwealth Grows."

LIB.23.t:0 "Releasing The Ivory Coast."
LIB.23.d:0 "The Ivory Coast shall be freed into our new African Commonwealth"
LIB.23.a:0 "Our Commonwealth Grows."

LIB.51.t:0 "Liberia Demands Sierra Leone"
LIB.51.d:0 "Liberia has long desired the state of Sierra Leone, seeing them as kind of a brother nation founded by slaves who were sent back to Africa from Canada. Now they have issued the French colonial overlords an ultimatum. Either we turn it over to them, or there will be war."
LIB.51.a:0 "Fine, let them have it."
LIB.51.b:0 "Are they serious? Absolutely not!"

LIB.52.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
LIB.52.d:0 "Now that the [From.GetAdjective] government has laughed our diplomats out of the conference room after hearing our demands, we are left with few options about how to proceed. Is this insult the beginning of a great liberation war, or is it another failed dream in Liberia?"
LIB.52.a:0 "That land shall be free, BY FORCE!"
LIB.52.b:0 "We cannot hope to oppose them on the battlefield."

LIB.53.t:0 "Sierra Leone is Ours"
LIB.53.d:0 "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government was too fearful of becoming embroiled in a war with us - they have agreed to surrender Sierra Leone to us."
LIB.53.a:0 "Excellent."

LIB.54.t:0 "We Control Sierra Leone"
LIB.54.d:0 "After brutal fighting with the exiled French, we have driven them from the countryside and deeper into the northern deserts. Our military cabinet believes we can negotiate with them on better terms. Signing a deal now would be a major political victory for us."
LIB.54.a:0 "Send the French the peace proposal."
LIB.54.b:0 "We are not ready for peace yet."

LIB.55.t:0 "The Liberians Offer Peace!"
LIB.55.d:0 "After an improbable victory of the pseudo-Americans in Liberia, we have retreated. The Liberian Army is securing its gains and preparing to move inland, but they offer to end all hostilities if we cede them Sierra Leone."
LIB.55.a:0 "Let the American and English fools rejoyce."
LIB.55.b:0 "Never! French Honour is on the line!"

LIB.56.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace!"
LIB.56.d:0 "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government refuses to see reason. We'll have to keep fighting."
LIB.56.a:0 "They'll live to regret this."

LIB.57.t:0 "Liberia Demands the Ivory Coast"
LIB.57.d:0 "Liberia has long desired the states of Elfenbeinküste and Akanland, seeing the Ivory Coast as kin. They have deluded themselves into wanting to free the Ivory Coast, that having family in America makes them nobility. They demand the surrender of the colony or war."

LIB.59.t:0 "Ivory Coast is Ours"
LIB.59.d:0 "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government was too fearful of becoming embroiled in a war with us - they have agreed to surrender the Ivory Coast."

LIB.60.t:0 "We Control the Ivory Coast"
LIB.60.d:0 "After brutal fighting with the Mittelafrikans, we have driven them from the countryside and deeper into the east. Our military cabinet believes we can negotiate with them now, plus signing a deal would be a major political victory for us."
LIB.60.a:0 "Send the Germans the peace proposal."
LIB.60.b:0 "No peace until we reach Dar Es Salaam!"

LIB.61.d:0 "After desperate fighting in the west, we have been forced to fall back. We believe the Liberian Army is securing its gains and preparing another assault. They also offer to end all hostilities if we cede them the Ivory Coast."
LIB.61.a:0 "Let them have that backwater countryside."
LIB.61.b:0 "Never! The German Army is Invincible!"

LIB.85.t:0 "A Bailout For Our Economy"
LIB.85.d:0 "After years of economic downturn since the Great Depression and now the effects of Black Monday, our fledgling economy is in tatters. What few economists we have in Liberia suggest we ask for a bailout one of the powers whose economic sphere we are in. We have the USA whom we share closer ties with, but they have a long list of issues at home. Then there is the German Empire, who is in better shape than the US but far less friendly to us. Our last, and by far least, savoury option is asking the Firestone Corporation. They have large economic influence here and aren't burdened down by operating nations with shopping lists of issues, however they also have the weakest moral fibre and are by far the most exploitative. Who shall we ask?"
LIB.85.a:0 "Our Old Friends Back in the States."
LIB.85.b:0 "Firestone will make us profitable."
LIB.85.c:0 "The Reich holds the Money and Power."

LIB.86.t:0 "Liberia asks for Aid"
LIB.86.d:0 "The Liberian government, crippled by the effects of Black Monday on top of their overwhelming national debt, has sent an envoy requesting the American government assist with a bailout. We have our own issues to deal with, but the amount they desperately need is small by comparison and will guarantee us a continued ally in Africa. How shall we respond?"
LIB.86.a:0 "Of course we will help."
LIB.86.b:0 "They are on their own."

LIB.87.d:0 "The Liberian government, crippled by the effects of Black Monday on top of their overwhelming national debt, has sent an envoy requesting the German government assist with a bailout. We have our own issues to deal with, but the amount they desperately need is small by comparison... and, in return, it seems likely they will join our military alliance in time, for what that's worth. Is another African ally worth the expense of being so magnanimous?"

LIB.88.t:0 "No [From.GetAdjective] Bailout"
LIB.88.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has flatly refused to provide us the bailout we so desperately need, clearly wrapped up in their own problems. To whom do we turn to now?"
LIB.88.a:0 "The Americans."
LIB.88.b:0 "The Germans."
LIB.88.c:0 "It seems Firestone is our only hope."

LIB.89.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees!"
LIB.89.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has graciously agreed to help Liberia with an economic bailout. It seems there is hope after all!"
LIB.89.a:0 "What a relief."

LIB.90.t:0 "Liberia Declares Independence"
LIB.90.d.default:0 "While Liberia has been a protectorate of [Root.GetNameDef] until now, today they declared their independence and have banished all [Root.GetAdjective] advisers from their government. There are concerns over the safety of [Root.GetAdjective] citizens remaining in Liberia, as well as a matter of national pride at stake... but is it truly even worth the cost of reprisal?"
LIB.90.d.germany:0 "While Liberia has been a protectorate of [Root.GetNameDef] until now, today they declared their independence and have banished all [Root.GetAdjective] advisers from their government. Word has it that they have aligned themselves with [GER.GetNameDef] and the Reichspakt, clearly believing the Germans will protect them from any [Root.GetAdjective] reprisal."
LIB.90.d.totalist:0 "While Liberia has been a protectorate of [Root.GetNameDef] until now, this changed after a totalist government came to power in a coup...and they have declared their independence and banished all [Root.GetAdjective] advisers from their government. There are concerns over the safety of [Root.GetAdjective] citizens remaining in Liberia, as well as a matter of national pride at stake... but is it truly even worth the cost of reprisal?"
LIB.90.d.natpop:0 "While Liberia has been a protectorate of [Root.GetNameDef] until now, this changed after a national populist government came to power in a coup...and they have declared their independence and banished all [Root.GetAdjective] advisers from their government. There are concerns over the safety of [Root.GetAdjective] citizens remaining in Liberia, as well as a matter of national pride at stake... but is it truly even worth the cost of reprisal?"
LIB.90.a:0 "They cannot escape so easily."
LIB.90.b:0 "We have little choice but to let them be."

LIB.91.t:0 "Liberia Wants to Join the Internationale"
LIB.91.d:0 "The Liberians, having recently become enlightened to the benefits of socialist government, have approached us with a request. They wish to formally join the Internationale. Would an ally in Africa be worthwhile?"
LIB.91.a:0 "Of course! We welcome them."
LIB.91.b:0 "We have no need of an ally such as them."

LIB.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
LIB.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance. Perhaps we are not syndicalist enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
LIB.92.a:0 "The Negro Worker magazine lied?"

LIB.93.t:0 "America Has Fallen"
LIB.93.d:0 "It seems the American government has collapsed in the face of its civil war. For better or worse, we are now on our own."
LIB.93.a:0 "So be it."

LIB.94.t:0 "The Return of Massaquoi"
LIB.94.d:0 "With our future secured and our debts wiped by Germany the time has come to install Albert Momolu Massaquoi as the formal head of state of Liberia, in order to facillitate our integration into the Kaiser's Kolonialbund. At least, that was the plan. It would seem that Mr. Massaquoi, now 67 years old, deems himself unfit to travel back to his homeland. He has privately approached us with a most peculiar request. His 32 year old daughter Fatima has just finished her studies at the Kaiserliche University in Hamburg and would be perfectly suited for the job. Some stuffy old Hauptmänner have objected to appointing an African woman to such a position, but considering the Liberian political machine isn't exactly going anywhere the reality of the situation is that Fatima would be little more than a figurehead for German rule over the country. A little progressivism to better accustom the locals to their benevolent new overlords is not out of place, ja?"
LIB.94.a:0 "What a time to be alive."

LIB.95.t:0 "Race Mixing Scandal!"
LIB.95.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to acclimate the Liberians to German rule, there has been a spot of controversy which involves our administration. Fatima Massaquoi moved to Monrovia with her husband, the Hamburger Richard Heydorn. As Richard is a white man and Fatima an African of Vai descent their relationship is not only seen as highly scandalous by the Amero-Liberian population but also deemed illegal on the grounds of their constitution. Liberian nationality law provides no special considerations for the non-citizen spouse of a Liberian citizen. Such a non-citizen can only acquire Liberian citizenship through the same naturalisation procedure laid out for other non-citizens, which stipulates that the applicant must be 'a Negro or of Negro descent'. Naturally both the continental German administration in Berlin and the Mittelafrikan administration in Westafrika have urged us to change this law, but doing so might be considered as infringement upon fundamental Liberian liberties. What should we do?"
LIB.95.a:0 "The German Empire will end racism!"
LIB.95.b:0 "Refrain from making too many public appearances together."

LIB.96.t:0 "Situation in the Hinterland"
LIB.96.d:0 "One of our most persistent challenges in Liberian history since 1822 is the resistance of tribal people to Americo-Liberian rule. It qualifies as the major obstacle to our nation-building. Historically, the toughest resistance came from the Vai, Gola and Loma in the north-west of the country, within and to the north of Liberia’s most western coastal county, Grand Cape Mount County. In the central part of the coastal region that during the first decades of colonisation constituted the republic’s territory, the Dei, in Montserrado County, and the Bassa and Kpelle, in Bassa County, fought the Monrovia-based government. Finally, in Sinoe County and in Liberia’s most eastern coastal county, Maryland County, the Kru and Grebo resisted Americo-Liberian authority over their lands and villages. The only region where our control is absolute is the coastal settlements, everywhere else we have had countless land disputes with our neighbors and endless conflict with the natives."
LIB.96.a:0 "And I thought Liberia was small on the map..."

fire.1.t:0 "The Puppet Legislature"
fire.1.d:0 "Now that the position of Harvey Firestone is secure, he has delegated a puppet legislature to serve under him and execute the day-to-day business of running the state. Controlling the Legislature is of course the True Whig Party, which under Firestone’s command has gained almost complete control over Liberia’s political scene. All semblances of opposition have been stamped out, and Firestone and the TWP rule with no competition. "

Naturally, the raises many questions as to the specific nature of the Firestone company's interests among Liberia's neighbors, especially given Mr. Firestone's recent rendezvous with the Prussian nobility in west Africa.\n\n Many people in Africa, many of them in positions of authority on the dark continent, are beginning to eye the new government in Liberia with trepidation."

Voices have been raised in the directorate about what we could do with this; namely restore the office of president of the United States right here in our enclave. Harvey Firestone himself is skeptical but Christie has assured the board that it would be a great boon to our currently shaky international standing, as well as a means of legitimising an eventual reclamation campaign against the rebellious America.

With the economic crisis in America not lifting, the US government has decided to hold us accountable to our debts, and our investors are likely to do the same. We must find a new source of income, and fast."
LIB_increase_taxes_desc:0 "Benjamin Franklin, a great American, once said that death and taxes were the only certainty in life. The $$1 Annual Hut Tax we added in 1932 will have to be increased threefold. American imports, items such as clothing and cameras will have tariffs imposed upon them. We shall rouse the Liberian people chip in for the prosperity of their children."
LIB_bailout_partner_desc:0 "It is oblivious that our own bootstraps will not save our deteriorating economy. Only by cooperating with an external partner can we save the economy. We can ask the Firestone Natural Rubber Company, the US government, or even Germany."
LIB_bailout_usa_desc:0 "In a final analysis, the US needs us more than we need them. If war comes to their shore, they will need an ally across the Atlantic. Let's send our foreign minister to the US, hammer out a way to forgive the $$3.4 million."
LIB_american_deal_desc:0 "The US agreed to a deal, but it they are as tough as ever. They recommend we declare bankruptcy, which activates a US provision that forgives our debt in exchange for forced austerity measures. Liberia would become an Unincorporated Unorganised Territory in every way but name."
LIB_tax_exemption_desc:0 "Since the US has now formalised the informal power that it exerted over Liberia, we now receive some US social services. We can do one, better, we demand triple tax exemption, which will help US businesses come to Liberia."
LIB_land_speculation_desc:0 "The Firestone Company came to Liberia only after speculators determined the land was suitable. If the US government could send more land speculators, we could deepen our resource pool and improve infrastructure."
LIB_bailout_firestone_desc:0 "We must prioritise the money that exists within Liberia already. Harvey Firestone own 1.5 million acres of land and is willing to help us out of debt. In his words, our solvency is a mark of pride for his business."
LIB_rubber_plants_desc:0 "Harvey Firestone has agreed to pay $$3 million in the form of treasury bonds and cash. In return, he asks for the Liberian government to extend certain 'benefits' to his associates at Ford."
LIB_facilitate_lobbying_desc:0 "Trouble within our ministries is erupting due to our deal with Firestone. They have proof that Firestone engages in slave labour and persecutes labour unions. Fortunately there is enough kickback left over to shut them up."
LIB_repair_railway_desc:0 "This new arrangement with Ford and Firestone requires us to rebuild the Main Line Railway. We will even drill our army along the line. Let's see if our saboteurs are brave enough to try again."
LIB_bailout_ger_desc:0 "Didn't our German ambassador, Massaquoi, have a plan for Germany to bail us out? We may have had our differences with Germany in the past, but that is history. the future of the world, of Africa, is probably in their hands."
LIB_join_germany_desc:0 "The deal on the table is the biggest to ever land on our doorstep. Join the German Empire, wipe away the debts. If the alternative is poverty and eventually slavery, we choose rule by the Germans."
LIB_german_industry_desc:0 "The German production method emphasises extensive planning in the engineering phase. Labour reducing machinery, cafeterias, and rousing music is sent to the Grain Coast as a gift."
LIB_german_tech_desc:0 "A second convoy arrives with scientists and schematics. The Kaiser intends for us to become a model colony, like Nigeria used to be for Britain. Let's hope Mittelafrika does not become jealous."
LIB_economy_direction_desc:0 "Finally, we have recovered from the slump that started with the US Depression. We must now ready our nation for whatever the future will bring."
LIB_civ_ind_1_desc:0 "The war is far away, and we still have many people unemployed. If we want to become a self sufficient economy, we need to make a long term investment."
LIB_mil_ind_1_desc:0 "The love of Liberty brought us to Liberia. We show our appreciation by arming ourselves. As our ancestors did."
LIB_mobilisation_1_desc:0 "Americo-Liberians are still the base of our army, and Monrovia is still the base of our power. We should construct new military railways to help effectively control the nation."
LIB_civ_ind_3_desc:0 "Monrovia, although our capital, is still a small town by European standards. If we construct new industry and homes we should see masses of workers coming in from the Hinterland looking for a job."
LIB_mobilisation_2_desc:0 "The Hinterland is still home to the vast majority of our population but most are not in contact with the Liberian government, effectively being independent entities. We should extend our infrastructure into the vast expanse to promote urbanisation and make military conscription much easier."
LIB_civ_ind_2_desc:0 "We should begin construction on a series of cities across the coast, shifting population from the jungles and increasing our industrial capacity."
LIB_mil_ind_3_desc:0 "When that German submarine fired warning shots at Monrovia in 1921, we had nowhere to hide. If we control Monrovia, we control Liberia."
LIB_mil_ind_2_desc:0 "Although Monrovia has preserved us for almost a century, we need to spread our zone of control south. Maryland, on the Ivorian border, provides us with access to French goods."
LIB_university_desc:0 "Our education system has never befitted our tradition of liberty. We can construct a new university in Montserrado County, and name it after the honourable D.B King"
LIB_oil_for_fleet_and_airforce:0 "The Monrovia Fuel Depo"
LIB_oil_for_fleet_and_airforce_desc:0 "One thing we need is Fuel. Fuel makes both ships and planes run, so having adequate fueling stations is a priority for our fledgling forces. "
LIB_civ_ind_4:0 "The Lifeblood Of Liberia"
LIB_civ_ind_4_desc:0 "Rubber is abundant in Liberia, and one of the resources we can develop to gain a profit. With the expansion of Liberia’s rubber industry, we will be one step closer to being a true developed nation. "
LIB_civ_ind_5:0 "The Maryland Coffee Plantations"
LIB_civ_ind_5_desc:0 "We are lucky enough to have an abundance of coffee in Liberia. Of course, in this day and age Coffee makes the world run, so selling our coffee is sure to make us a pretty penny. "
LIB_friendsinwestafrika:0 "Friends in Westafrika"
LIB_friendsinwestafrika_desc:0 "To the east of Liberia lies the westernmost part of Mittelafrika; Westafrika. In less confusing terms, there might be someone out there willing to strike a deal with us. What the Staathalter doesn't know..."
LIB_puppetlegislature:0 "Puppet Legislature"
LIB_puppetlegislature_desc:0 "Although Firestone is now completely in control of the country, the Liberian political machine does not have to stop spinning. We will simply make it spin for us instead."
LIB_thegoldenhandshake:0 "The Golden Handshake"
LIB_thegoldenhandshake_desc:0 "To contain radicalism and to secure their investments in the country, Firestone rubber has moved forward with a direct intervention in Liberian politics. A new order will be built now, one where Americo-Liberian interests will never be threatened again."
LIB_monrovianovertures:0 "Monrovian Overtures"
LIB_monrovianovertures_desc:0 "Monrovia is the main seat of power of the Americo-Liberians; it would be prudent to get them on our side before moving forward."
LIB_businessasusual:0 "Business as Usual"
LIB_businessasusual_desc:0 "Christie's plan will never work. It is better to concentrate on what we are good at here at Firestone; making money."
LIB_deepenourcommitment:0 "Deepen Our Commitment"
LIB_deepenourcommitment_desc:0 "Lansdell K Christie's plan to save the best America has to offer is our best bet to ensure the survival of capitalism with the advent of the American Civil War. We will use Liberia as a vessel to preserve the American way of life in, now and forever."
LIB_theduke:0 "The Duke"
LIB_theduke_desc:0 "Duke Nicholaus von Oldenburg appears to be quite interested in 'liberating' some of the natives in the Hinterland from our rule. Magnanimous as we are, we would certainly like to consider making him an offer."
LIB_themercenaries:0 "The Mercenaries"
LIB_themercenaries_desc:0 "In the Gold Coast there is a band of soldiers of fortune who would be more than willing to bolster the weak, corrupt and unprofessional Liberian Frontier Force. Commander Andrew Cipriani in particular seems like a good candidate to oversee operations."
LIB_plantationcheckpoints:0 "Plantation Checkpoints"
LIB_plantationcheckpoints_desc:0 "In order to accomodate ourselves in Liberia Lansdell K Christie has proposed the construction of self-sustaining plantation fortresses. Even though Harvey Firestone himself has reservations in the veracity of the broader extent of Christie's plans, building these complexes seems like a safe bet to secure our position here."
LIB_onenationundergod:0 "One Nation Under God"
LIB_onenationundergod_desc:0 "Liberia, as an extension of America in Africa, is a Christian nation. A few strategic investments in the church apparatus should silence any remaining Negro dissent within the upper class. Everyone else will listen to their pastor unquestioningly anyway."
LIB_anunscrupulousliberia:0 "An Unscrupulous Liberia"
LIB_anunscrupulousliberia_desc:0 "Under Firestone's supervision a measure of stability has returned to Liberia. This would be a good time to acclimate the True Whig Party's politicians to the new order."
LIB_anamericainafrica:0 "An America in Africa"
LIB_anamericainafrica_desc:0 "The Civil War has presented a unique opportunity for Liberia. With Christie's plan we can put an end to backwards tribalism and turn the country into what it was always meant to be; an America in Africa."
LIB_forafistfulofdollars:0 "For a Fistful of Dollars"
LIB_forafistfulofdollars_desc:0 "Our plan is nearing its final stages of completion. Liberia has been transformed. The last thing left to do is address our subjects on the radio."
LIB_thegreatmigration:0 "The Great Migration"
LIB_thegreatmigration_desc:0 "It has begun. The finest sons and daughters of the United States of America have come to our sanctuary in Africa by the tens of thousands. Let Haywood and Long fight it out amongst themselves, for one day we will return and restore the old ways of can-do capitalism. For now though, we have our Enclave."
LIB_republicwithoutdemocracy:0 "Republic Without Democracy"
LIB_republicwithoutdemocracy_desc:0 "The original United States was a republic, yes, but the constitution said nothing about this socialistic concept called 'democracy'. Firestone's Liberia is a republic like the America of old, without any of the trappings that destroyed the America of yesterday. Hail Columbia!"

LIB_our_destiny:0 "It is Our Destiny"
LIB_our_destiny_desc:0 "The time has come. All the final preparations are in order and President Hoover is ready to reclaim America from traitors and Rebels. Throughout the chambers of the false pretenders, Let Freedom Ring!"

LIB_our_finest_hour_desc:0 "Against all odds on this earth, we have managed to pull it off.
