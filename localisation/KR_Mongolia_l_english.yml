MON_the_great_buddhist_icon_desc:0 "Though Ungern-Sternberg is not a tulku like the Bogd Khan, he should still be known as a buddhist figure of almost equal importance in Mongolia. Fortunately foundational work like the Tibetan Agvan Dorzhiev's work 'The Shambhala Prayer' is already well known and easy material to manipulate for propaganda."
MON_the_greatest_dictator:0 "Cult of Personality"
MON_the_greatest_dictator_desc:0 "To make sure Ungern-Sternberg remains in power, the propaganda around his cult of personality should be temporarily increased massively. This cult of personality relies on mythmaking that officer Ossendowski is adept at spinning."

MON_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "The officer class is a hotbed for noble traitors, socialist rebels and buddhist extremists. Their loyalty should be tested and hardened to root out these issues.

MON_urga_military_parade_desc:0 "Nothing gets the peoples support and shows dominance more than a military parade. To the people of Urga, a military parade is more of a holiday than a display of power, owing to the newness of the concept.

MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Much of the population lives a nomadic lifestyle, not in the cities or towns.

MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc:0 "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power. The radical buddhists and rich princes had large power in our government. Now, with them defeated, we can centralise power under Ungern-Sternberg, so that he can protect the nation."
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities:0 "Propaganda in the Cities"

mongolia.6.a:0 "We shall not stand for this lack of respect! To arms!"
mongolia.6.b:0 "Enough blood has been shed. Submit to Sternberg and the Mongols."
mongolia.7.t:0 "Ungern Khan Descends Upon Xinjiang"
mongolia.7.d:0 "The Mad Baron has unleashed his Asiatic Cavalry Division on the steppes of the northwest, sending panic through the stumbling forces of the Ma clique. An outright counter invasion from our mountain fortresses seems thoroughly dangerous, but we may with stealth and forgery usurp power in the lowland province of Lanzhou, improving our defences tenfold by securing the western banks of the Yellow River entirely."

Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"

Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."

Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people?

But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army, which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility. Leaders of the Mongol tribes under the command of the aristocratic 'noyan' Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors".

Sternberg does not have enough men in his party to overcome Meiren’s forces decisively, meaning a bloody conflict would ensue.

mon.176.d:0 "Altanochir is a prince from Inner Mongolia, who only very recently travelled to Urga from Inner Mongolia, after recommendation from Prince Demchugdongrub. It should already be clear as to why he is on the chopping block. Demchugdongrub pushed to gain power during the chaos of the Western Revolt. It was his clique of princes and nobles who almost led to our downfall. Altanochir, still being quite a low level military leader, should be an obvious one to be purged."
mon.176.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.176.b:0 "End him."
mon.177.t:0 "The Purge has Ended"
mon.177.d_small:0 "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Whether it can even be called a purge is up for debate, due to the relatively minor amount of actions that were taken against possible traitors. The military leaders of Mongolia who survived breathe a sigh of relief, though some may still scheme against us."
mon.177.d_medium:0 "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were executed throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors. Those remaining breathe a sigh of relief, as the military staff of the nation grows ever smaller."

mon.177.a:0 "It was necessary."
mon.178.t:0 "37 People Die in Factory Explosion"
mon.178.d:0 "Following Ungern's new policy of Aggressive Industrialisation, construction of new factories, sponsored mostly by Russian businessmen, sprung up across the nation. With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. Rezukhin commented that it was the fault of the workers doing poor work, a statement Ungern agreed with."
mon.178.a:0 "They should be more careful next time."
mon.179.t:0 "Mongol Ardīn Nam Cell Destroyed near the Russian Border"
mon.179.d:0 "After receiving information from one of our informants placed in the MAN, we learned the location of a major MAN cell, just on the Russo-Mongolian border. So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."
mon.179.a:0 "Finally, peace can be secured."
mon.180.t:0 "Hundreds of Soldiers Imprisoned for Refusing to Pledge Allegiance to Ungern"
mon.180.d:0 "With new measures implemented recently, forcing every soldier to pledge their full allegiance to Ungern-Sternberg, hundreds have refused to do so. Many of them claim that they do not serve Ungern, but rather serve the nation of Mongolia. However, what they fail to see is that these are one in the same. For this betrayal, these soldiers have been imprisoned, so that they cannot spread dissent against us."
mon.180.a:0 "Traitors everywhere!"
mon.181.t:0 "Battle Between Princes Guard and Mongolian Revolution Army"
mon.181.d:0 "Many of the rich nobles and princes of Mongolia have their own guard with them at all times, almost like a private army. After hearing that they were going to have their lands seized to be distributed to the populus, a few princes decided to unite their guards to protect their lands. After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."
mon.181.a:0 "Those who refuse to follow the revolution must be forced."
mon.182.t:0 "Russia has Fallen"
mon.182.d:0 "It appears the worst has happened. Our great allies in the north, the Russian Bear, has fallen. Taken down from the inside by German spies and Bolshevik agents no doubt. Now, we are forced to go it alone. Someday, perhaps, we might free the people of Russia, and perhaps restore the rightful Romanov rulers to their throne. For now, however, we will struggle to survive."
mon.182.a:0 "We must go alone."

mon.55.t:0 "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
mon.55.d:0 "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government. Though the Baron survived, this attempt showed weakness, and the chaos Ungern caused by killing the possible MAN agents can’t be good for our popularity."
mon.55.a:0 "At least the Baron survived."
mon.56.t:0 "[MON.GetLeader] asks for weapons"
mon.56.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has asked our government for weapons, to help him defend Mongolia from its enemies. Mongolia is our foothold in China, and it might be best to keep it on our side."
mon.56.a:0 "Send them arms."
mon.56.b:0 "We are too busy."
mon.57.t:0 "Russia agreed to send arms"
mon.57.d:0 "Russia have sent us a shipment of guns, and have agreed to do this every year so long as we remain in power."
mon.57.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.58.t:0 "Russia refused to send arms"
mon.58.d:0 "Russia have decided to no longer send us any arms."
mon.58.a:0 "Damn."

mon.63.t:0 "Mongolia asks for guarantees"
mon.63.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader], currently leader of Mongolia, has requested that we guarantee their nation, to keep them safe from outside threats. This will cement them as our influence in the region."
mon.63.a:0 "Guarantee them."
mon.63.b:0 "We don't want to be pulled into Chinese affairs."
mon.64.t:0 "Russia has agreed!"
mon.64.d:0 "Russia has agreed to give us guarantees, to keep us safe from outside threats."
mon.64.a:0 "Excellent."
