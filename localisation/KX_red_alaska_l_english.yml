REDAlaska.1.t:0 "A White Devil snakes through the grass"
REDAlaska.1.d:0 "Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner stood at the podium, orating a fiery and impassioned speech to a massive crowd of his followers and countrymen. The great chief talked of the dangers of our foes, the White Man, and of our destiny to reach out into the world and save our downtrodden brethren across this continent. As Towner carried on, his voice growing more bombastic and unwavering as the speech continued, a venomous snake began to sneak through the crowd. This treacherous serpent was one of the White Men to survive a recent raid on the White settlement in what was once Nome, and he had come to this great gathering for blood. As this daemon stalked the crowd, drawing ever closer to the podium at which Chief Towner stood, he began to reach inside his jacket, preparing himself for his dark deed. Chief Towner was mid sentence when a thunderous crack sounded; the White Devil had pulled a gun and fired a shot at our dear leader! Before he could fire off another, the fool was mobbed by the crowd, who began to beat the man mercilessly with anything they could find, bringing swift justice to this attempted-murderer. While this commotion continued, aides and guards rushed to the Chief, fearing the worst for the great unifier of the First Peoples. Among these guards rushing the stage was none other than Medicine Crow, paramilitary leader and one of Towner’s closest associates. As the crowd finished their mob justice and looked back towards the stage, they waited with baited breath to see the outcome of this horrific turn of events..."
REDAlaska.1.a:0 "The bullet merely hit his shoulder! Chief Red Cloud stands once more to continue his speech."
REDAlaska.1.b:0 "The shot hit the Chief’s heart. His successor starts making moves to secure power..."

REDAlaska.2.t:0 "The Great Crow Chief"
REDAlaska.2.d:0 "Medicine Crow, now Chief Medicine Crow, was one of the late Chief Red Clouds’ closest compatriots and firecest allies. A member of the Apsáalooke tribe, or “Crow Tribe” as the White Man used to call them, Medicine Crow came to Beringia like so many others of his tribesmen, fleeing the fires of the Second American Civil War. Upon his arrival, he integrated into Towner’s administration, proving himself to be a brilliant scholar and historian as well as a fierce warrior and tactfully-minded politician. He served Chief Red Cloud valiantly as a leader of the various paramilitary groups that fought to exterminate the White Man, with his time in combat further radicalizing his views. When not waging war, the skilled man would spend hours recording and researching old oral myths and records, piecing together the histories of the various peoples of Beringia, earning their respect along the way. This blend of talents and disciplines helped him catapult himself to the center of the late Chief Towner’s inner-circle, despite their heterodoxical differences in ideological thought. Though both men agreed on much, such as the expulsion and punishment of the White Men and the upliftment of the Red Race, the two men also held numerous differences in opinion on how these should be carried out. Medicine Crow, with his influences from the Mau-Mau in Kenya shining bright, felt that not under nationalist furor but under the red light of Totalist thought would our great people march into the future. Now that the great Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner has been slain, and Medicine Crow now rules, he can finally make his dreams a reality. Under his command, Beringia will be transformed into a new Red Man’s state, one not just Red in race, but Red in ideals and ideology as well. Only Totalism, only Chief Medicine Crow can lead the Red Man to greatness!"
REDAlaska.2.a:0 "He shall blaze a new path for the Red Man, under the red light of Totalism"

REDAlaska.3.t:0 "The Crow’s Warrior Bands"
REDAlaska.3.d:0 "With his ascension to Chief of Beringia, Medicine Crow has moved to make his various paramilitary groups into official arms of the state. These Braves now act as extensions of Chief Medicine Crow’s own will, carrying out his orders across Beringia and deep into enemy territory. Giving them an open-mark on how to achieve his own goals, his now fully state-backed militias and warrior parties stalk the wilds of Beringia and the suburbs of the decadent white settlements, handing out justice as they see fit. Chief Medicine Crow knows that the only way that we will ever be free of the White Man’s influence is to be fully free of the White Man themselves, and the easy way to free ourselves from these beasts is with blood."
REDAlaska.3.a:0 "These Red-blooded braves do our nation and peoples proud"

REDAlaska.4.t:0 "Red Man’s Internationale"
REDAlaska.4.d:0 "Chief Medicine Crow has called a meeting in Dzántik'i Héeni, or what was once Juneau, to congregate with his fellow Totalist natives from across the New World. Among the most prominent of  the groups to make an appearance were the Totalist Peruvians, who claim to be descended from the great Inca, as well as various smaller groups from Hawai’i, the Yucatan, and Patagonia, among others. This great Pow-Wow of true Red Men has allowed us to foster close ties with these familiar and similar movements across this great continent as we all seek to cast off the yoke of the imperialist dogs. Though the meeting contained little substance and was mostly for show, it has still cemented our legitimacy as a true Totalist state in the world, greatly improving our international legitimacy."
REDAlaska.4.a:0 "We have held our own opulent meeting, proving to other “reds” of the world that we too are dedicated to the Totalist cause"

REDAlaska.5.t:0 "Indian Totalism"
REDAlaska.5.d:0 "Despite all of his public pomp and outspoken support of Totalism, behind closed doors, Chief Medicine Crow was a fundamentally different man. Caring not for ideology nor theory, Medicine Crow simply cared for his people. His heavy heart could not bear to see the state of squalor his fellow Native lived in, and so reached out to Totalist thought as the only means he could think of saving them. The leftist powers of the world love to chime in to help a lost cause, and it was Medicine Crow’s belief that only by fully giving himself over to the Red ideology could he gather the support and tools necessary to truly save his people. Though he was far from a puppet to these other powers, he still had to throw in with their lot to gain their trust, and more importantly, their tools of war. With the backing of the Totalist Charter member-states, Medicine Crow has been able to equip his Braves and war-parties with weapons of war that far outmatched anything his own people would have been able to create on their own, given their limited industry in the frozen north of The Last Frontier. Chief Medicine Crow would swallow his pride and hide a deep shame in his gut if it meant saving his people once and for all!"
REDAlaska.5.a:0 "I will do what I must to ensure the future of the Red Race"

REDAlaska.7.t:0 "The marks of a true warrior"
REDAlaska.7.d:0 "he young warrior stalked through the dense conifer-brush, bow in hand, looking for his prey. Out on a hunting trip for his local village, the boy was tracking the trail a large buck had left behind when a crack of a twig snapping under footfall caught his attention. Instantly dropping low into the brush, the keen-eyed hunter narrowed his vision towards the source of the noise. From across the clearing, a disheveled Canadian soldier emerged from the treeline, clearly lost as he strained to look at his map in the pale light of this early dawn. Stowing his bow, the young Red-blooded hunter drew his tomahawk, hoping to complete the necessary feat for becoming a man in the eyes of the Beringian culture. As the Canuck waltzed past him, completely unaware of his presence, the young hunter waiting on held breath for the perfect moment to strike. As the lost soldier stopped to take a sip from his canteen, an ear-piercing warcry froze him in fear as the native boy lept towards him, hatchet in hand. In a flurry of blood and gore, the soldier’s scalp was severed from his skull as he cried out in horror and agony. His attacker let out one last shrill cry before running off into the wilds, scalp in hand, as the lost warrior collapsed to the ground as he passed out from the pain. Hours later, the native boy had returned to his village, hefting his trophy high above his head. His kin and fellow villagers flocked to him as they congratulated him on his deed as the village chief began to perform the rites of manhood upon the brave hunter. He was now a man in the eyes of the Red Man."
REDAlaska.7.a:0 "With this scalp, you too become a ma"

REDAlaska.9.t:0 "The Great Raid"
REDAlaska.9.d:0 "We have spent months preparing for this final fight; this final great raid into the heart of the White Man’s den. We move to strike the black heart of these imperialist dogs, to remove them once and for all from our sacred continent! Stealing and siphoning arms from international shipping lanes, buying black market weapons of war from famous gun-runners like the Senussi or the Indochinese, and even accepting the aid from our Totalist “brothers” overseas, we have fully prepared our troops for the coming storm. The drums of war shall beat one last time across the great state of Beringia as we move to annihilate these pestilent insects and remove them from our ancestral lands! We shall avenge the dead, the downtrodden, the forgotten. We shall seek retribution for all those of Red skin and Red blood who have shamelessly had their lives stolen from them by these White Devils. We will march into their opulent city on the hill and cut each and every one of them down for daring to ever raise arms against our creed. We shall be victorious like our ancestors at the Battle of Little Bighorn, and avenge the losses of our heroes such as Tecumseh or Chief Red Cloud. The time of reckoning is upon us, the time of Custer’s Nightmare!"
REDAlaska.9.a:0 "We march into the den of the beast, and we shall not return until our final task is finished. We will have our revenge!"

REDAlaska.8.t:0 "An Ideal Paradise"
REDAlaska.8.d:0 "The war has been won. The flame of the White Man’s destruction has been snuffed out once and for all. We wake this morning to the dawn of the Red sun, whose shining light shall bathe this newly cleansed continent in its red glow. Inside our illustrious borders, a renaissance of the old ways has begun. Children play lacrosse or snow snakes while adults swap stories and oral traditions. Our historians have begun to transcribe the histories of each one of our constituent tribes as our artists and weavers create fantastical works of majesty to honor the Great Raid and our centuries-old struggle against the White Devils. We have returned to the ways of old, fusing them with our new modern ideals for the betterment of the Red Race. The Red Man has never seen such jubilation and happiness since the first white-capped ships landed on our eastern shores all those years ago. A home has finally been created for our people, not in some far off land, but in the original lands of our forefathers. Outside of our borders, however, lies a hellscape like none other on earth. Massive fortifications and walls have been erected to keep the savages out as the remaining White invaders devolve farther and farther into animalistic behavior, becoming the very savages they claim us to be. Our brave soldiers patrol the perimeter, putting any White Dog down as they see fit, with frequent raiding parties being launched into the wilds to strip these former-imperialists of what little dignity and supplies they have left. We are not the White Man; we will not feign the possibility of civilizing these beasts. They are animals and monsters, and nothing more, and they will be treated as such. Inside our walls lies heaven, a new promised land for the Red Race, and for the Red Race only. Outside these walls are none of our concern. They exist now only to serve or amuse us, the true inheritors of this great Mikinoc Waajew."
REDAlaska.8.a:0 "We have finally proven who the real savages are"

REDAlaska.6.t:0 "The Killing Fields"
REDAlaska.6.d:0 "In Beringia, a system of homesteading exists where the Beringian government shall give out large swathes of acreage to new families seeking to start a new life here in The Last Frontier. This has caused a mass influx of hopeful farmers into the wilds of Beringia, causing a crisis in our soil’s fertility until a *brilliant* a solution was discovered; one that our government has tried to hide at all costs. One such hopeful family was given a 20-acre plot on the outskirts of Tanan, or what was once Fairbanks in the White Man’s tongue. The young family worked the land tirelessly for months, tilling the fertile soil and sowing the seeds of both the crops and their futures in the unusually fecund fields. One afternoon, after weeks of harsh rains and hailstorms that caused much of the top soil to erode and become muddy, the youngest son of this bright-eyed family was playing in the fields of lettuce and beetroots when he suddenly tripped over an odd protuberance jutting from the muck. To his horror, the boy locked eyes with the cause of his fall: a severed, desiccated human arm sticking out from the soil. Crying out in fear, his parents rushed to the scene, taking in the horrific sight as they approached their whimpering kin. At once, the father ran to the phone to call the local administration to report this horrific sight, and within a half-hour, the dark cars of Beringian officials began to pull up to the homestead. As the government men worked to reburry the detached limb, others scoured the fields for any sign of other *fertilizers* threatening to break through the top-soil. While the underlings worked, the head officer sat down with the family behind closed doors, ensuring they would not speak a word of this to anyone, paying them off with a large sum and adding a few additional acres to their property as compensation for their ordeal. The terrified family were made to understand that this was the only good use for the White Man, and with it, their futures would be secure, but only if they kept their mouths shut."
REDAlaska.6.a:0 "These fields run red with the blood of our enemies, finally giving a use for the White Man"
